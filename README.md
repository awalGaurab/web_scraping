# Web scraping with python
This is my first attempt on web scraping with python.
I have tried to read all the job listing in the indeed job finding website.
I am trying to get data scientist job in Tokyo,Japan.

I have created a csv file with the job title,company name and job location for each of the data scientist job.

Here,I have attached the full code that read data from multiple pages and the data read from the webpages are saved to the csv file.
Then we have use for loop to read data from multiple webpage.
